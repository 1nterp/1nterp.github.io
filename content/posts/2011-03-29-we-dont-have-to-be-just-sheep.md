  One of my favorite cartoonists is Gary Larson, the creator of The Far Side, a long running single panel syndicated comic. Of all his work, perhaps one of my favorites is, “Just Sheep.” In this comic, large herds of snowy white sheep graze lazily in the fields. In the middle of this lazy pack of cotton balls, a single sheep stand on its hind legs with his arms raised to the sky and shouts, with Norma Rae exuberance, “WAIT! WAIT! LISTEN TO ME… We don’t have to be just sheep!” Wow… what a profound statement for a sheep. I love this comic. Not only is it typical Far Side funny, it is also powerfully transferable from sheep to humans. Yes, it’s true; we don’t have to be just sheep.&nbsp;

  We don’t have to follow the pack nor do we have to accept the status quo. Each of us maintains the right to refute the ideology that things are as they should be, and we are only to conform to the existing state of affairs. I say, “If you don’t like, change it,” or as the rapper Mos Def raps, “You gotta love it or leave it alone.” The status quo is representative as to how things are, but not how they have to be. We have the power to change, to be what we want, and to live how we want. We too can be the exception and stand above the crowd.&nbsp;

  This is nothing new; the concept of changing your life to be what you want it to be is as old as time. Just take a quick look back at human history. There was a time when humans simply grew weary of walking, so we mounted a camel. Soon we got tired of being stuck between humps and creeping along at camel speed, so we hopped on a horse. Eventually, we got tired of riding solo, or at best tandem, and we created the buggy. Armed with a need for speed and an increased desire to rid the streets of smelly horse droppings, we eventually invented the car. Cars soon bored us, so we created urban defense vehicles, better known as SUVs. Just like the liberated sheep, humans have always managed to rise above the status quo to create a new reality. We have a knack for opening doors where none seem to exist.&nbsp;
